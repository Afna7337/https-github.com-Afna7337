| **Project**      | **Description**                                                                                  |

| **[Project 1](https://github.com/)** |doctor review system : Patients need easier ways to discover, review, and evaluate healthcare providers. Simultaneously, early detection tools for brain tumours can assist clinicians by flagging suspicious scans. This project demonstrates a combined platform for community feedback on doctors and a research-grade image-analysis pipeline for brain MRI that showcases my full-stack and ML engineering skills.|
--
| **[Project 2](https://github.com/)**    |The Lost & Found System is built with Python and Flask. Registered users can create accounts, post reports for lost or found items (title, description, location, photo), and Other related complaints file through online. Police accounts act as administrators â€” they review incoming reports and complaints, respond to users, accept claims, mark items as resolved, and take further action when required. The workflow centralizes reporting, reduces paperwork and phone calls, and streamlines police follow-up so officers spend less time on admin and more on action. Registered users can create accounts, post reports for lost or found items and file related complaints online.|

| **[Project 3](https://github.com/)** | Pixel Runner is a Unity (2D) endless runner designed to showcase gameplay feel and production polish. The player continuously runs forward while the system spawns procedurally-generated obstacles and collectibles. I focused on creating a responsive movement system (acceleration, jump buffering, smooth landings), scalable obstacle patterns that increase difficulty over time, and a lightweight economy that rewards skillful play. To keep the game performant on lower-end devices, I implemented object pooling for all frequently spawned objects, optimized update loops, and reduced garbage collection spikes. The final demo includes a main menu, pause, simple shop for cosmetic unlocks, and a high-score leaderboard (local).|
